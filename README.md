A repository with different document templates in LaTeX.

This is designed to work on [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to enable writing TeX files directly in the cloud without the need for a paid subscription, e.g., Overleaf.  See `.devcontainer` and `.vscode` for configurations.  With free add-ons like [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/) you can collaborate in real time.  Since this is a version controlled repo, all your changes can be tracked, forked, or rolled back as needed.

# Citation

The logo.png for this repository was generated using Google Gemini Flash 2.0 (Imagen 3) on Feb. 18, 2025 with the prompt "Create colorful logo of a the black rail bird (Laterallus jamaicensis) writing a document." Note that it has hallucinated a third appendage ðŸ˜„! The black rail (*[Late]rallus [jam]aicensis*) was chosen as a logo based on the similarity of its scientific name to LaTeX.
